          CSAE refers to child sexual abuse and exploitation, including content or behavior 
          that sexually exploits, abuses, or endangers children. This includes, for example, 
          grooming a child for sexual exploitation, sextorting a child, trafficking of a 
          child for sex, or otherwise sexually exploiting a child.
